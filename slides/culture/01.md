# Culture #

.notes I think about this a lot. Like gavialib sez, we must all become labour
theorists. But I'm not very good at it yet.

# What's great about libraries? #
* Long-term thinking
* Non-profit motive
* Image

.notes Especially in academia -- we're the people who work together rather
than apart -- like some tenure track guys. Consequently, we can be *really* 
attractive to tenure track people who may be trying to compete with their
department over dollars, prestige, etc.

# What isn't? #
* "We've always done it that way."
* Hiring.
* Conservative culture, especially in IT.

.notes any group will have conservatives. Often cons are a good bulwark against ingrained organizational ADD. But too much sway and you never get any damn thing done ever. Hiring is hard too. Can we hire? Or should we train in-house? Or combo of both?

# What about the private sector? #

.notes we're talking about a specific sort of private sector culture, not
*everybody* in PS. *usually* this means startups/smaller companies but not
always. Bad and good culture exists across all groups. Small "i" innovative. :)

# What's worth pursuing? #
* Risk taking
* "20% time"
* More collective decision making  
* Managers not as bosses, but as facilitators

.notes 37signals model, google on the 20%. Note that this can be hard to do
especially with an excessively conservative work culture.

.notes OK, happy guy. But a lot of startups and other biz encourage people
to work way over 40 hours, to eat/sleep/live at office, and this ultimately
will lead to bad decision making and other effects. Occasionally is fine. 
*all* the time is not.

.notes I could not find a good CC/PD sack of money image so I had to make one.
