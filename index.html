<p class="notes">ask if anyone's heard of these. If so particularly what do they think. Do they have experience of this at their own institutions? Can you gauge the level of interest? Try to define DH. Go ahead, try. I dare you. "Anything that ain't compilers".</p>

<p class="notes">Especially in academia -- we're the people who work together rather
than apart -- like some tenure track guys. Consequently, we can be <em>really</em> 
attractive to tenure track people who may be trying to compete with their
department over dollars, prestige, etc.</p>

<p class="notes">any group will have conservatives. Often cons are a good bulwark against ingrained organizational ADD. But too much sway and you never get any damn thing done ever. Hiring is hard too. Can we hire? Or should we train in-house? Or combo of both?</p>

to work way over 40 hours, to eat/sleep/live at office, and this ultimately
will lead to bad decision making and other effects. Occasionally is fine.

<p class="notes">Could not do this with standard admin. Note that some work scenarios

using VM insures that we can provide that if needed. Also, ~10-15 minutes to

<p class="notes">Source code as the new peer review. This is an easy way we can demonstrate our utility as well as give back and make a name for ourselves generally. Viz CHNM, with Zotero, etc. <em>VERY</em> important that we have license flexibility (DFSG compliant) as we'd like to default to an open source license (as part of SLA? maybe). github is pre-eminent source code hosting service. http://github.com/scds/ We did our slide deck there, f'rinstance.

<li><em>Anything</em> iterative and text based...</li>
<li>... and everything <em>should</em> be iterative and text based</li>
<li>provides portability, flexibility, history tracking</li>
<li>Surprisingly, this is a new concept to many academic tech types</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">We will try to be flexible on many fronts -- languages, operating systems, service hours and service levels, but I would like to stick with one standard for documenting and sharing code. We've been using git for a while. Having documented changes and distributed backups of stuff is a Good Idea. <em>BUT</em> doing version control -- not just git, any VC -- requires a major rethinking of workflow and may be a harder sell to more conservative types. BUT you get ENORMOUS value for the time spent, for which I will talk your ear off at any point during this conference.</p>
